Create a python application that has a json object that contains recipes from different cousines and has the structure cousine.<cousine_name>.<recipe_name>.<ingredients>.<measurement>.

The application should generate 5 random recipes and generate a list of all the ingredians and quantities you need. If you are not happy with the 5 you can reroll 5 new recipes or you can select some recipes that you want to randomize.
